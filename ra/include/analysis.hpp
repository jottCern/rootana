 *
 * For the first part, derive from this class and implement the 'begin_dataset' and 'process' methods.
 *
 * Calling 'begin_dataset' or 'process' can be done either
 * - "manually" from another AnalysisModule or from a SFrame cycle
 * - "automatically" by using the AnalysisModuleRunner SFrame cycle which does nothing but call these
 * methods in the correct order, after setting up the input.
