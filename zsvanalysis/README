Overall workflow

1. create ntuples with CMSSW

2. run this framework on ntuples, see workflow.sh
 This will run different configurations, e.g. to split the Z+jets samples
 to their components (Z+b, Z+c, light. ttbar into ttbar+bbbar and rest)
 It also creates root files with plots
 
3. plot the output of 2.
  run ./plot_reco
  other plotting programs can be used for other configurations, e.g.
  for gen-level plots
  
4. run the fit on m_ll (in each bin of DeltaR(B,B)). The fit itself is done with
  theta. The script performing the fit and running theta is
  mllfit_workflow.sh
  To plot the result of the mllfit, use plot_zpurity_fits
