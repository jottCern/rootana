This implements a thin compatibility layer to read in UHH2 ntuples
and run UHH2 AnalysisModules, where UHH2 refers to the code
here:
https://github.com/UHH2/UHH2/

This provides an infrastructure independent of sframe for
distributed processing of root ntuples with a much smaller code base
and a larger feature set.
